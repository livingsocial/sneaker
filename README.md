#Sneaker.coffee

Sneaker is object-oriented, highly testable jQuery.

+ **Extends jQuery.** jQuery shouldn't be synonymous with spaghetti; Sneaker lends simple structure to the best of jQuery.
+ **Written for CoffeeScript.** Sneaker provides an object definition pattern geared towards legibility and self-documentation.
+ **Jasmine-friendly, with mocks.** Sneaker's `API` object has the notion of mocking responses built-in, to aid in both development and testing; and the library comes with a bundle of handy Jasmine matchers.  
+ **Architecture-neutral.** Your job shouldn't be reduced to manipulating the magic inside a black-box application object, reaching towards a rough approximation of your intended experience.  Write exactly what you intend to have happen.
+ **Don't call it a framework.** Sneaker has no interest in reinventing, reimplementing, or revolutionizing.  Sneaker doesn't try to save developers from themselves.  The intention with Sneaker is to bring greater clarity to your current approach through a small set of independently useful bits; nudging you towards legible, testable code that those who inherit your project will thank you for, instead of burning effigies in your likeness.

###Lace up
1. Include `sneaker.coffee` as you would any other vendored script.

2. [`jQuery 1.8 or later`](http://jquery.com/download/) is required.

3. For testing with Jasmine, include `sneaker-matchers.coffee` into your spec manifest.

4. [`Lo-Dash >= 1.0.1`](https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js) is used by some of the matchers.

5. [This ES5 shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/blob/master/es5-shim.js) is recommended if you need to support browsers that aren't fully down with ES5 arrays, so that `Sneaker.Box` is fully functional.

###Contributing
Source code is found under `/source`.  Tests are found under `/tests`.
Release candidates are queued up on the branch named `next` - pull requests for contributions should be pointed there.  Branch `master` represents the current release version.

###Testing
`guard`

Gems `guard-jasmine` and `jasminerice` employed to run tests.
While guard is running, the coffeescript will be compiled to the same file name under `/compiled`, if you'd like to look it over.

###Building
